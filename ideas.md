  **Design Movement**: **Cyber-Brutalism meets High-End Fintech**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Unapologetic Confidence**: Big, bold statements. No hiding.
  2.  **Raw Data as Art**: Exposing the underlying metrics and "code" as visual elements.
  3.  **Privacy as a Vault**: The feeling of entering a secure, impenetrable space.
  4.  **Speed & Efficiency**: Interactions should feel instant and sharp.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Base**: `oklch(0.15 0 0)` (Deepest Charcoal/Black) - Represents the "black box" of privacy, but accessible.
  *   **Accent**: `oklch(0.6 0.25 300)` (Electric Magenta/Purple) - Used for "Alpha" moments—high value, high impact. Not a soft gradient, but a sharp laser.
  *   **Intent**: To evoke the feeling of a high-frequency trading terminal or a secure command center. It's dark because it's serious. It's purple because it's royal/wealthy.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Modular/Bento Grid**: Information is compartmentalized into strict, bordered zones.
  *   **Asymmetry**: The grid is not uniform. Key metrics break the grid.
  *   **Sticky Headers/Footers**: Constant access to the "Request Access" CTA, like a ticker tape.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Monospace Data Streams**: Background textures of scrolling encrypted data or "live" GPU optimization logs.
  2.  **The "Bracket" Motif**: Deconstructing the logo's brackets to frame key content, acting as a visual "shield."
  3.  **Glitch/Reveal Effects**: Hovering over "redacted" text reveals the value proposition, simulating the decryption process.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Hover-to-Decrypt**: Users have to actively engage to see the "secret" layer.
  *   **Snap Scrolling**: Sections lock into place, emphasizing the "step-by-step" logic of the argument.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Typewriter/Terminal Text**: Headlines appear character by character.
  *   **Sharp Easing**: No soft bounces. Movements are linear or exponential. Fast and precise.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: *Space Mono* or *JetBrains Mono* (Bold, Uppercase) - Technical, raw, code-like.
  *   **Body**: *Inter* (tight tracking) or *Switzer* - Clean, legible, but neutral.

  **Design Movement**: **Ethereal Futurism / "The Void"**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Mystery & Depth**: The interface feels like looking into a deep, infinite space.
  2.  **Fluid Intelligence**: AI is represented not as code, but as a living, flowing entity.
  3.  **Subtle Power**: Strength is shown through restraint and elegance, not aggression.
  4.  **Seamless Privacy**: Privacy is the air you breathe, invisible but essential.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Base**: `oklch(0.1 0.02 280)` (Deep Void Blue/Purple) - A darkness that has depth and richness, not just flat black.
  *   **Accent**: `oklch(0.7 0.15 290)` (Glowing Amethyst) - Used for soft, ambient lighting and gradients that guide the eye.
  *   **Intent**: To create a sense of awe and inevitability. The "Future" concept.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Central Axis / Z-Axis Navigation**: Content flows towards the user from the center, or the user moves "through" the content into the depth of the screen.
  *   **Floating Elements**: Content cards float in void space, unaffected by gravity.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Generative Particle Flow**: A background of millions of particles (representing data) that flow around the user's cursor but never touch it (privacy).
  2.  **Glassmorphism 2.0**: Dark, frosted glass layers that blur the background, creating depth and hierarchy.
  3.  **Light Leaks**: Subtle purple glows that pulse from the edges or behind elements.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Fluid Follow**: Elements gently sway or tilt in response to mouse movement.
  *   **Smooth Scroll**: A heavy, inertial scroll feel that adds weight to the experience.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Slow Morphing**: Shapes and gradients slowly evolve over time.
  *   **Fade & Scale**: Elements enter from the background, scaling up and fading in.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: *Cinzel* or *Playfair Display* (modified) - Elegant, sharp, almost historical but modernized.
  *   **Body**: *Satoshi* or *General Sans* - Modern, geometric, high readability.

  **Design Movement**: **Constructivist Noir / "The Architect"**
  **Core Principles**:
  1.  **Structure & Foundation**: Emphasizing Lugano as the *infrastructure* layer.
  2.  **Hidden Complexity**: Simple surfaces hiding complex machinery.
  3.  **Architectural Precision**: Everything is measured, aligned, and purposeful.
  4.  **Dark Luxury**: The aesthetic of a high-end private club or a vault.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  *   **Base**: `oklch(0.12 0.01 260)` (Obsidian) - A solid, heavy dark grey/blue.
  *   **Accent**: `oklch(0.55 0.2 310)` (Royal Purple) - Used as "architectural lighting" to highlight structural lines.
  *   **Intent**: To convey stability, security, and exclusivity. The "Hidden Layer" concept.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  *   **Split Screen / Parallax**: One side is static (the promise), the other is dynamic (the proof).
  *   **Layered Reveal**: As you scroll, top layers slide away to reveal the "infrastructure" underneath.

  **Signature Elements**:
  1.  **Architectural Lines**: Thin, 1px purple lines that draw the grid and connect elements.
  2.  **Cutout Typography**: Big headlines that act as windows into the layer behind (video or animation).
  3.  **Isometric Illustrations**: Abstract, 3D representations of the "stack" (GPU, Privacy, SDK).

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  *   **Scroll-Linked Animations**: The user controls the construction/deconstruction of the UI.
  *   **Precise Hover States**: Buttons and cards have sharp, mechanical state changes.

  **Animation**:
  *   **Slide & Reveal**: Panels slide open like automatic doors.
  *   **Line Drawing**: Borders and connecting lines draw themselves in.

  **Typography System**:
  *   **Headlines**: *Unbounded* or *Syne* - Wide, distinctive, structural.
  *   **Body**: *DM Sans* or *Manrope* - Technical, highly legible.
